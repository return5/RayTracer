# RayTracer
simple lua ray tracer built from [Ray Tracing In One Weekened](https://raytracing.github.io/)

this code generates a sample image similar to the one in the book:

also generates a sequence of images which are then put together into animated GIFs:

### note:
  * there are almost no comments in this code. i built it as i followed the book and as such i consider the book to be documentation for the code.
  
  * doesnt seem to play nice with luajit. dont know enough about using luajit to even guess as to why. 
  
  * i am by no means an expert at writting efficient lua code so there are plenty of ways to optimize and write this code tons better. I may do this as a future project.
