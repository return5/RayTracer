# RayTracer
simple lua ray tracer built from [Ray Tracing In One Weekened](https://raytracing.github.io/)

this code generates a sample image similar to the one in the book:

  ![screenshot1](/pics/sample.png)
  
  
  
also generates a sequence of images which are then put together into animated GIFs:

![screenshot1](/pics/pan.gif)

### note:
  there are almost no comments in this code. i built it as i followed the book and as such i consider the book to be documentation for the code. that, along with what i consider to be readable code serve as all the documentation for this project.
